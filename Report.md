Overview of the analysis: <br> 
The purpose of this analysis is to help the nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup decide on applicants to fund for their ventures. We will do this by creating a binary classifier to determine if the applicant would be succesful with funding using machine learning and neural networks.<br>
<br>
Results:<br>
<br>
Data Preprocessing<br>
<br>
What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model? <br>
The target variable in this dataset is the IS_SUCCESSFUL column, (1) being successful while (0) is unsuccessful <br>
<br>
What variable(s) are the features for your model? <br>
From the dataset, the feature variables would be all the columns aside from the IS_SUCCESSFUL column. These include: <br>
APPLICATION_TYPE<br>
AFFILIATION<br>
CLASSIFICATION<br>
USE_CASE<br>
ORGANIZATION<br>
STATUS<br>
INCOME_AMT<br>
SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS<br>
ASK_AMT<br>
<br>
What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.
