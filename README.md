For this challenge, we are tasked with helping the foundation Alphabet Soup find the most suitable applicants to fund for their ventures. We do this through the creation of a binary classifier with our knowledge of machine learning and neural networks. The goal is to create a classifier that can achieve at least a 75% accuracy in prediciting the candidates that would be successful.
