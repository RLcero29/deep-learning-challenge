For this challenge, we are tasked with helping the foundation Alphabet Soup find the most suitable applicants to fund for their ventures. We do this through the creation of a binary classifier with our knowledge of machine learning and neural networks. The goal is to create a classifier that can achieve at least a 75% accuracy in prediciting the candidates that would be successful. We are given 3 attempts to create a model that achieves this accuracy. Different ways to optimize the model include increasing or decreasing the amount of neurons in the hidden layers, changing the activation functions, and adding or removing hidden layers from the model. In addition to using lecture activites and recorded class lectures for help with this challenge, in Google Colab sometimes the code would be auto-completed with suggestions on how to code each cell after typing a bit of code out myself. Sometimes this code would be correct, and other times not, but I used my better judgement to decide if it was what I was going to put anyways.
